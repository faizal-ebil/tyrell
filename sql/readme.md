b. SQL Logic Test

- The provided SQL query seems to be quite complex due to multiple joins and search conditions, which might be affecting its performance. Here are some suggestions for improving the performance of the query:

- Indexing: Ensure that the columns used in the WHERE clause, JOIN conditions, and GROUP BY clause have appropriate indexes. Indexing can significantly speed up the retrieval process.

- Avoiding Wildcard Searches: The LIKE '%value%' pattern can be very slow on large datasets because it requires a full table scan. If possible, avoid using this pattern for searching. If you need to perform text-based searches, consider using a full-text search solution like MySQL's built-in FULLTEXT indexes. The search criteria was flight attendant. It should take one table that related with flight attendant. The jobs table is the best place to search it.

- Pagination: The use of LIMIT and OFFSET can become slower as you move through the result set. Consider using keyset pagination instead, where you track the last retrieved value and use it as a starting point for the next query.

- Reducing JOINs: It looks like there are many left joins that might not be necessary for every query. If some of the data from these joins is not always required, you might consider moving them to subqueries or separate queries to fetch the data when needed. 

- Use EXISTS: In cases where you only need to check for the existence of related data, consider using EXISTS instead of a full join. This can be particularly helpful in cases where a job might have multiple related items (e.g., personalities, skills), and you just need to know if there's any related data.

- Denormalization: Depending on your data access patterns, denormalizing some of the data into the main jobs table could reduce the need for excessive joins.
